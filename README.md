# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

**Development:**

- `npm start`
  - Starts the development server on port `3000`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
  - Hot reloading keeps your app up-to-date while you make changes.
  - Displays any linting errors in the console.

**Testing:**

- `npm test`
  - Runs the test runner in interactive watch mode.
  - Refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

**Production Build:**

- `npm run build`
  - Creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.
  - Bundles React in production mode for optimal performance.
  - Minifies and uses hashed filenames for reduced file size.
  - Ready for deployment (see below).

**Customization (Advanced):**

- `npm run eject` (**NOTE:** One-way operation)
  - Removes the single build dependency (Create React App) from your project.
  - Copies configuration files and dependencies into your project for complete control.
  - Use this only if you need to significantly customize the build process.
